# 🧠 Sumit's Learning in Public Journey

Welcome to my daily log of growth, bugs, breakthroughs, and brain-boosting chaos.  
I'm learning in public to stay accountable, build confidence, and maybe inspire a few along the way. 🚀

## ✅ Day 7 – Maths Meets Recursion (C++)

**Topics Covered:**
- 🔢 **Basic Maths Problems**:
  - Digit count, number reversal, palindrome check  
  - GCD calculation, prime number verification  

- 🔁 **Intro to Recursion**:
  - Print your name N times using recursion  
  - Number printing patterns: 1 to N, N to 1  
  - Understood base cases and recursive flow through dry runs  

💬 *Today was a mix of logic and repetition.*  
Math problems laid the groundwork, and recursion started to train my brain to “think in calls” instead of loops. 🔁📞

## ✅ Day 6 – Revision Day: Solidifying the Foundation

**Topics Reviewed:**
- 🔄 STL Containers: `vector`, `list`, `deque`, `stack`, `queue`, `set`, `multiset`, `unordered_set`  
- 🧠 Basic C++ concepts: functions, loops, conditionals

💬 *Today was about sharpening what I already knew.*  
Revisiting old problems helped me catch gaps and build stronger intuition.  
Consistency > speed — and revision keeps the mind sharp. ✍️

## ✅ Day 5 – Multiset & Unordered Set (C++ STL)

**Topics Covered:**
- 🎯 `multiset` – Allows duplicates, keeps everything sorted  
- ⚡ `unordered_set` – Hash-based, no order, blazing fast lookups  
- 🧠 Use-cases for managing duplicates and optimizing search time  
- 🔄 Practiced insertions, deletions, `count()`, and iterating through elements  

💬 *Today was about containers that either love duplicates or don’t care about order.*  
Sometimes, performance > perfection.

## ✅ Day 4 – STL Containers Deep Dive (C++)

**Topics Covered:**
- 🪄 `list` – Doubly linked list magic  
- 🧱 `deque` – Double-ended queue with flex on both sides  
- 🥞 `stack` – Last In, First Out drama  
- 🧾 `queue` – First In, First Out logic  
- 🔥 `priority_queue` – Because sometimes order *does* matter  
- 🧺 `set` – Unique elements only, no duplicates allowed 🎫  

💬 *STL containers are like Pokémon — each one has its special power. And today, I caught 'em all.*  
Mastering these will supercharge my problem-solving and code efficiency ⚡

---

## ✅ Day 3 – Vectors in STL (C++)

**Topics Covered:**
- 🧠 Understanding `vector` as a dynamic array  
- 🔁 Using `push_back()`, `pop_back()`, `insert()`, and `erase()`  
- 📏 Playing with `size()`, `capacity()`, `resize()`  
- 🧭 Iterating with for-loops and iterators  
- 💣 Handling memory efficiency and element positioning  

💬 *Vectors are like arrays—but with superpowers.*  
No more static limits. Just clean, flexible, resizable magic 💫

---

## ✅ Day 2 – Logical Thinking & Pattern Building

**Topics Covered:**
- 🔍 Pattern-based problem solving  
- 🧠 Developing logical flow for structured code  
- 📌 Learning how to identify, repeat, and reuse logic  

💬 *Today wasn’t about writing more code — it was about writing better code.*  
🧱 Building patterns, training the brain to solve smart, not hard.

---

## ✅ Day 1 – Core Programming Foundations

**Topics Covered:**
- ✅ User Input / Output  
- ✅ Data Types  
- ✅ If-Else Statements  
- ✅ Switch Statement  
- ✅ Arrays & Strings  
- ✅ For Loops  
- ✅ While Loops  
- ✅ Functions (Pass by Reference & Value)  
- ✅ Basics of Time Complexity  

🧩 **Focus:** Built the groundwork for coding logic  
💡 **Insight:** Understanding syntax is cool, but thinking in code is cooler

More coming daily. Let’s build consistency and confidence — one commit at a time. 🔥
