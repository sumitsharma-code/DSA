# 🧠 Sumit's Learning in Public Journey

Welcome to my daily log of growth, bugs, breakthroughs, and brain-boosting chaos.  
I'm learning in public to stay accountable, build confidence, and maybe inspire a few along the way. 🚀

## ✅ Day 12 – Merge Sort Using Recursion (C++)

**Topics Covered:**

- 🔁 Implemented **Merge Sort** using recursion
- 🧩 Understood divide-and-conquer strategy
- 🧠 Split the array, sorted subarrays, and merged them back
- ⏱️ Time Complexity: O(n log n), space: O(n)

💬 _Merge Sort is where recursion meets order._  
Breaking things apart and putting them back together — clean, efficient, and powerful.

---

## ✅ Day 11 – Sorting Begins: Selection Sort (C++)

**Topics Covered:**

- 🔀 Started learning **Sorting Algorithms**
- ✅ Implemented **Selection Sort** from scratch
- 📉 Understood how it selects the minimum and swaps step by step
- ⏱️ Time Complexity: O(n²), ✅ space-efficient (in-place)

💬 _Sorting is where logic meets optimization._  
Selection sort may be basic, but it lays the foundation for deeper techniques ahead.

---

## ✅ Day 10 – Hashing with Maps (C++)

**Topics Covered:**

- 🗺️ **Number Hashing** using `map<int, int>` and `unordered_map<int, int>`
- ⚡ Compared performance: log time vs average O(1) access
- 🔄 Solved frequency counting and duplicate detection problems
- 📊 Understood tradeoffs in speed, memory, and ordering

💬 _Maps are like smart containers — they know where everything is, fast._  
Choosing the right one makes all the difference in solving problems efficiently 🧠

---

## ✅ Day 9 – Hashing It Out (C++)

**Topics Covered:**

- 🔢 **Number Hashing** using arrays for constant-time lookups
- 🔡 **Character Hashing**: lowercase, uppercase, and full ASCII maps
- 🧠 Solved problems involving frequency counting and fast access
- 💡 Learned how hashing optimizes time complexity in repeated queries

💬 _Hashing is like having an answer key before the exam._  
It makes lookups lightning fast ⚡ and saves time on brute force.

---

## ✅ Day 8 – Diving Deeper into Recursion (C++)

**Topics Covered:**

- 🔸 **Parameterized Recursion** – Passing values through the recursive stack
- 🔸 **Functional Recursion** – Returning computed values from each call
- 🔁 Solved a **multiple recursive call** problem (felt like a brain workout!)

💬 _Recursion got deeper today — and more interesting._  
Learning when to pass, when to return, and how the stack unwinds made a huge difference.  
One function, many layers — one logic, multiple paths. 🧠✨

---

## ✅ Day 7 – Maths Meets Recursion (C++)

**Topics Covered:**

- 🔢 **Basic Maths Problems**:

  - Digit count, number reversal, palindrome check
  - GCD calculation, prime number verification

- 🔁 **Intro to Recursion**:
  - Print your name N times using recursion
  - Number printing patterns: 1 to N, N to 1
  - Understood base cases and recursive flow through dry runs

💬 _Today was a mix of logic and repetition._  
Math problems laid the groundwork, and recursion started to train my brain to “think in calls” instead of loops. 🔁📞

---

## ✅ Day 6 – Revision Day: Solidifying the Foundation

**Topics Reviewed:**

- 🔄 STL Containers: `vector`, `list`, `deque`, `stack`, `queue`, `set`, `multiset`, `unordered_set`
- 🧠 Basic C++ concepts: functions, loops, conditionals

💬 _Today was about sharpening what I already knew._  
Revisiting old problems helped me catch gaps and build stronger intuition.  
Consistency > speed — and revision keeps the mind sharp. ✍️

---

## ✅ Day 5 – Multiset & Unordered Set (C++ STL)

**Topics Covered:**

- 🎯 `multiset` – Allows duplicates, keeps everything sorted
- ⚡ `unordered_set` – Hash-based, no order, blazing fast lookups
- 🧠 Use-cases for managing duplicates and optimizing search time
- 🔄 Practiced insertions, deletions, `count()`, and iterating through elements

💬 _Today was about containers that either love duplicates or don’t care about order._  
Sometimes, performance > perfection.

---

## ✅ Day 4 – STL Containers Deep Dive (C++)

**Topics Covered:**

- 🪄 `list` – Doubly linked list magic
- 🧱 `deque` – Double-ended queue with flex on both sides
- 🥞 `stack` – Last In, First Out drama
- 🧾 `queue` – First In, First Out logic
- 🔥 `priority_queue` – Because sometimes order _does_ matter
- 🧺 `set` – Unique elements only, no duplicates allowed 🎫

💬 _STL containers are like Pokémon — each one has its special power. And today, I caught 'em all._  
Mastering these will supercharge my problem-solving and code efficiency ⚡

---

## ✅ Day 3 – Vectors in STL (C++)

**Topics Covered:**

- 🧠 Understanding `vector` as a dynamic array
- 🔁 Using `push_back()`, `pop_back()`, `insert()`, and `erase()`
- 📏 Playing with `size()`, `capacity()`, `resize()`
- 🧭 Iterating with for-loops and iterators
- 💣 Handling memory efficiency and element positioning

💬 _Vectors are like arrays—but with superpowers._  
No more static limits. Just clean, flexible, resizable magic 💫

---

## ✅ Day 2 – Logical Thinking & Pattern Building

**Topics Covered:**

- 🔍 Pattern-based problem solving
- 🧠 Developing logical flow for structured code
- 📌 Learning how to identify, repeat, and reuse logic

💬 _Today wasn’t about writing more code — it was about writing better code._  
🧱 Building patterns, training the brain to solve smart, not hard.

---

## ✅ Day 1 – Core Programming Foundations

**Topics Covered:**

- ✅ User Input / Output
- ✅ Data Types
- ✅ If-Else Statements
- ✅ Switch Statement
- ✅ Arrays & Strings
- ✅ For Loops
- ✅ While Loops
- ✅ Functions (Pass by Reference & Value)
- ✅ Basics of Time Complexity

🧩 **Focus:** Built the groundwork for coding logic  
💡 **Insight:** Understanding syntax is cool, but thinking in code is cooler
