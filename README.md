# 🧠 Sumit's Learning in Public Journey

Welcome to my daily log of growth, bugs, breakthroughs, and brain-boosting chaos.  
I'm learning in public to stay accountable, build confidence, and maybe inspire a few along the way. 🚀

## ✅ Day 4 – STL Containers Deep Dive (C++)

**Topics Covered:**
- 🪄 `list` – Doubly linked list magic  
- 🧱 `deque` – Double-ended queue with flex on both sides  
- 🥞 `stack` – Last In, First Out drama  
- 🧾 `queue` – First In, First Out logic  
- 🔥 `priority_queue` – Because sometimes order *does* matter  
- 🧺 `set` – Unique elements only, no duplicates allowed 🎫  

💬 *STL containers are like Pokémon — each one has its special power. And today, I caught 'em all.*  
Mastering these will supercharge my problem-solving and code efficiency ⚡

## ✅ Day 3 – Vectors in STL (C++)

**Topics Covered:**
- 🧠 Understanding `vector` as a dynamic array  
- 🔁 Using `push_back()`, `pop_back()`, `insert()`, and `erase()`  
- 📏 Playing with `size()`, `capacity()`, `resize()`  
- 🧭 Iterating with for-loops and iterators  
- 💣 Handling memory efficiency and element positioning  

💬 *Vectors are like arrays—but with superpowers.*  
No more static limits. Just clean, flexible, resizable magic 💫

## ✅ Day 2 – Logical Thinking & Pattern Building

**Topics Covered:**
- 🔍 Pattern-based problem solving  
- 🧠 Developing logical flow for structured code  
- 📌 Learning how to identify, repeat, and reuse logic  

💬 *Today wasn’t about writing more code — it was about writing better code.*  
🧱 Building patterns, training the brain to solve smart, not hard.

## ✅ Day 1 – Core Programming Foundations

**Topics Covered:**
- ✅ User Input / Output  
- ✅ Data Types  
- ✅ If-Else Statements  
- ✅ Switch Statement  
- ✅ Arrays & Strings  
- ✅ For Loops  
- ✅ While Loops  
- ✅ Functions (Pass by Reference & Value)  
- ✅ Basics of Time Complexity  

🧩 **Focus:** Built the groundwork for coding logic  
💡 **Insight:** Understanding syntax is cool, but thinking in code is cooler
